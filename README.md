## Objective ðŸ¥…

The objective of the challenge will be to make a predictive model based on Random Forests that allows knowing the type of air quality based on the measurements of the sensors.

## The Data ðŸ’¾

Features: The dataset contains 8 features in 8 columns, which are the parameters measured by the different sensors. These correspond to the different interactions that the laser beams have had when passing through the air particles.

Target: The target corresponds to the 'label' that classifies the quality of the air.
- Target 0 corresponds to Good air quality 
- Target 1 corresponds to Moderate air quality
- Target 2 corresponds to Dangerous air quality
